# TODO List for Mental Health Companion Agent Update

- [x] Remove authentication imports and setup (streamlit_authenticator, config.yaml loading for auth)
- [x] Remove login call and conditional rendering based on authentication_status
- [x] Update agent prompt to mental health companion role
- [x] Adapt tools: rename store_research_paper to store_personal_reflection, retrieve_relevant_papers to retrieve_supportive_notes, update descriptions for mental health context
- [x] Change app title to "Mental Health Companion Agent"
- [x] Test the app to ensure it runs without login and agent responds appropriately
